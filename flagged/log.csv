It's burning me. What should I do doctor?,"With what I see, I think you have a severe case of acne rosacea or possibly acne vulgaris, which is causing the redness, inflammation, and acne lesions on your face. I would suggest trying topical creams or gels containing sulfur or salicylic acid to help reduce inflammation and prevent future breakouts, and also considering oral antibiotics if the condition is severe, and in the meantime, I would advise you to keep your face clean with a gentle cleanser and avoid picking or rubbing your face to prevent scarring.",,,,2025-06-27 02:41:02.064259
